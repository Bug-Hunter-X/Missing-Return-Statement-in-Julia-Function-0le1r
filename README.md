# Julia Function with Missing Return Statement
This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: a missing return statement in a function that leads to an error when the function's execution doesn't reach an explicit `return` statement.

The `bug.jl` file contains the code with the error. The `bugSolution.jl` file shows the corrected version.
